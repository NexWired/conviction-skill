  "thesis": "The market underestimates the power of incumbency and party continuity. VPs who run for president after a two-term administration have historically performed well when the economy is stable. Vance's youth, populist appeal, and established national profile give him structural advantages. The Democratic field is fragmented with no clear frontrunner. However, 2028 is far out and significant uncertainty remains, hence medium confidence.",
